# emPC-A/RPI & emPC-A/RPI3 by Janz Tec AG
This script installs and configures Linux **Socket CAN**, **serial port** and **RTC** drivers

## :white_check_mark: Installation Instructions:

Our pre-installed images are based on Raspbian Jessie with Linux kernel version 4.4. If you want to use newer kernel, you can try our "Installation Instructions (Experimental)" below.

**Step 1:**

Install one of the listed RASPBIAN operating system versions from below: 

(Raspbian Jessie Lite, or Raspbian Jessie recommended. NOOBS installation **not** supported)

1) **_emPC-A/RPI3_: Raspbian Jessie version 2016-09-28**
   * Lite:

**Step 2:**

```
sudo bash
cd /tmp
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janztec/empc-arpi-linux-drivers/master/install.sh -O install.sh
bash install.sh
```

## Installation Instructions (Experimental):

**:heavy_exclamation_mark:  WARNING!! EXPERIMENTAL**

In newer Raspbian images the Linux kernel is installed in version 4.9 (or later) and therefore the script install.sh will no longer work correctly. For this newer Linux kernel versions, our new driver installation script install-experimental.sh is still under development. 

**Step 1:**

Install one of the listed RASPBIAN operating system versions from below: 

3) **Experimental: Raspbian Stretch version 2017-08-16 or later**

   install-experimental.sh script uses the mainline kernel driver sources with only a few source code patches, see install-experimental.sh for more details. Our performance optimizations of the CAN, UART and SPI drivers are currently not included in these mainline drivers.

**Step 2:**


```
sudo bash
cd /tmp
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janztec/empc-arpi-linux-drivers/master/install-experimental.sh -O install-experimental.sh
bash install-experimental.sh
```
